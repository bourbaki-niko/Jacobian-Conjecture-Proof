# Jacobian-Conjecture-Proof
This repository contains the work on the proof of Jacobian Conjecture By explicitly identifying how nilpotency propagates through recurrence relations to force termination and unifies diverse operational observations from previous works.
The highlight of the approach is that it transforms the Jacobian Conjecture from a mysterious existence question into a concrete operational mechanism with explicit bounds and verifiable consequences. Once the mechanism is identified, the proof becomes almost inevitable - similar to how understanding the right operational structure often clarifies previously mysterious mathematical phenomena.
This speaks to a broader principle in mathematics: sometimes the most challenging problems aren't about proving something exists, but rather about discovering the hidden operational structure that explains why it must be so.
